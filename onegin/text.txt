
That year autumnal weather
was a long time abroad;
nature kept waiting and waiting for winter.

Snow only fell in January,
on the night of the second. Waking early,
Tatiana from the window saw
at morn the whitened yard,
flower beds, roofs, and fence;
delicate patterns on the panes;
the trees in winter silver,
gay magpies outside,
and the hills softly overspread
with winter's brilliant carpeting.
All's bright, all's white around.
